# Final Project: Extending First-Order Logic with Lists and Recursion

This README is generated by chatGPT for initial version.

## Overview

This project extends a natural deduction (ND) system for first-order logic (FOL) by adding inductive data types and recursive reasoning. We implemented the system in Beluga and proved multiple theorems constructively.


- `extend_fol_nat_list.bel`: Initial version, went a little ahead and added nat alongside list, so we could model properties like add(n, 0) = n or length(append(...)) = ... 

- `extend_fol_list.bel`: Use list as the only inductive type, and express length, equality, and recursion purely on lists.
(Not yet finished.)

TODO: I will finish the alignment and complete the recursion operator and `listElim` in the code.

## Features

- **Inductive Types**:
  - `nat`: natural numbers (`z`, `suc`)
  - `list`: lists of natural numbers (`nil`, `cons`)
  
- **Logical Extensions**:
  - `eq`, `eqList`: equality predicates for `nat` and `list`
  - `addR`, `lengthR`, `appendR`: relational encodings of recursive functions
  - Full ND-style reasoning (`⊃I`, `∀I`, etc.)

- **Induction Schemas**:
  - `nat_ind_schema` and `list_ind_schema` to express structural induction in LF
  - Sample proofs using these schemas

## Sample Theorems Proved

- `add(n, z) = n`
- `append(l, nil) = l`
- `length(append(l1, l2)) = add(length(l1), length(l2))` (in progress)
- Reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity of `eq` and `eqList`
- Concrete examples like `add(1, 1) = 2`, `append([0], [1]) = [0, 1]`, etc.

## Design Notes

- The system models recursive functions relationally (e.g., `addR n m p` means `n + m = p`)
- Induction is expressed as higher-level schemas (`nat_ind_schema`) rather than as part of ND directly
- Both `nat` and `list` are fully supported, but can be simplified to list-only if desired (e.g., representing natural numbers as repeated `cons`)

## File Structure

- All definitions and proofs are included in a single `.bel` file
- Each proof includes inline comments for clarity
